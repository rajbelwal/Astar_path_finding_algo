# WHAT IS A* ALGORITHM ??

A* algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that uses both uniform cost search and greedy best-first search to find the shortest path between two points in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the distance from the current node to the goal node and a priority queue to explore promising paths first. A* algorithm is widely used in areas such as video games, robotics, and other applications where finding an optimal path is important.
